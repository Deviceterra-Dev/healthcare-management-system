## Architecture

The project follows a microservices architecture where different services are responsible for specific functionalities. The services communicate with each other via RESTful APIs.

## Services

### User Service

Handles user registration, authentication, and management. This service includes roles such as patient, doctor, admin, and superadmin.

### API Gateway

Acts as a single entry point to the system. It routes requests to the appropriate services and handles authentication and authorization.

### Appointment Service

Manages appointment scheduling, including creating, updating, and deleting appointments.

### MongoDB

A NoSQL database used to store all the data for the healthcare management system.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Running the Project

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/healthcare-management-system.git
cd healthcare-management-system
```

2. Set up environment variables:

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:

```env
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
MONGO_URI=mongodb://mongo:27017/user_service
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret_key
FLASK_ENV=development
SUPERADMIN_EMAIL=your_superadmin_email
SUPERADMIN_PASSWORD=your_superadmin_password
```

3. Build and run the services using Docker Compose:

```sh
docker-compose up --build
```

The services will be accessible on the following ports:
- User Service: `http://localhost:5000`
- API Gateway: `http://localhost:8000`
- Appointment Service: `http://localhost:5001`
- MongoDB: `mongodb://localhost:27017`

## Environment Variables

- `SECRET_KEY`: Secret key for Flask application.
- `MONGO_URI`: URI for connecting to MongoDB.
- `JWT_SECRET_KEY`: Secret key for JWT authentication.
- `FLASK_ENV`: Environment setting for Flask (`development` or `production`).
- `SUPERADMIN_EMAIL`: Email for the super admin account.
- `SUPERADMIN_PASSWORD`: Password for the super admin account.

## API Documentation

API documentation is available using Swagger. After starting the services, you can access the documentation at:

- User Service: `http://localhost:5000/apidocs`
- API Gateway: `http://localhost:8000/apidocs`
- Appointment Service: `http://localhost:5001/apidocs`
